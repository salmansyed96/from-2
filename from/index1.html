                <p>The Affordable Care Act, which is also referred to as ACA
                    or Obamacare, was signed into law by President Barack
                    Obama in 2010. The act was a major overhaul of the U.S.
                    healthcare system, reducing the amount of
                    uncompensated care the average family pays for.
                    Obamacare originally required everyone to have health
                    insurance and offered cost assistance to those who could
                    not afford a plan on their own.</p>
